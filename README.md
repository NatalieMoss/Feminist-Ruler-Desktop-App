## Kivy Feminist Ruler Desktop App ü¶∂üìè‚ôÄÔ∏è

This project includes a Kivy-based app that allows you to convert imperial measurements (feet and inches), which are based on the length of King Henry I's foot length, to a new unit of measure called the nefeet. The nefeet is based on the length of Queen Nefertiti's feet. Now go forth and remeasure your world with a feminist ruler!

### How to Run the Kivy App

Follow these instructions to get the Kivy app running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
2. Install the required dependencies (including Kivy):
     ```bash
    pip install kivy
3. Navigate to the folder containing the main.py file and run it:
   ```bash
   python main.py

The app will open, and you can input imperial feet and inches to get the conversion result. So fun!

The Kivy app is located in the `/kivy_app` directory, and includes the following files:
- `main.py` (Python script for the app logic)
- `calculator.kv` (Kivy language file for the layout)
